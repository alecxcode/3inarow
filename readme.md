# 3 in a Row Game
This is a simple Lua game example to demonstrate algorythms implementation.
The game is related to the type of *match 3*. The purpose of gameplay is to place 3 or more equal elements (they are known in this game as **crystals**) in a row or a column.
To do this, the player can make a move of a crystal by one cell left, right, up, or down.
Only those moves that create 3 in a row (column) matches are allowed.

To play the game use Lua interpreter; run: `lua main.lua`
